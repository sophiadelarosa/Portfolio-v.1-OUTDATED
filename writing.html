<h3> Effects of Immigration Ban felt by Texas State Students</h3>
<h4>by Sophia De La Rosa</h4>

<p>The effects of President Trump’s immigration ban can be felt by people around the world, including students, faculty and staff at Texas State University. </p>

<p>President Trump signed an Executive Order on Friday banning visa and green-card holders from seven different countries from entering the United States, causing an eruption of protests across the nation. </p>

<p>Denise Trauth, president of Texas State University, released a statement on Tuesday which said that 18 students, two visiting scholars and two faculty members are affected.</p>

<p>“We recognize that this Executive Order has caused disruption and consternation in our community,” Trauth said. “Now is the time to commit to our long-held beliefs in non-discrimination and equal opportunity.”</p>

<p>Students across campus are having mixed reactions about the immigration ban and President Trumps’ first week in office. Robert Armstrong, a senior, said he believes something needed to be done.</p>

<p>“I’m a conservative veteran who understands national security, so I agree with what he has done,” said Armstrong. “I don’t agree with how the media has portrayed it.”</p>

<p>Armstrong said President Trump is only doing what he said he was going to do, untrue of past presidents.</p>

<p>“People need to open up their minds and understand what he’s trying to do,” said Armstrong. “He’s trying to make America safe.”</p>

<p>Other students don’t feel so confident in Trump’s decisions so far. Gustavo Torres, a senior, feels Trump is undermining America’s motto of being the land of opportunity.</p>

<p>“How are you going to tell me it’s constitutional to ban a group of people that earned their right to be here?” Torres said. “It just doesn’t make sense. On a land that was built by immigrants.”</p> 

<p>Torres said this is dark foreshadowing of the future of Trump’s presidency although he is trying to remain optimistic.</p>

<p>“I think in the long run it will do more good, because from what I’ve seen is that people are more united than we think,” Torres said. “The fact that thousands of people are going out to airports and protesting this shows how healthy our democratic system is.”</p>

<p>Other students are saddened but feel out of control. Sophomore Emily Morris is trying to stay positive.</p>

<p>“I try to be optimistic and try not to believe everything he says,” said Morris. “I don’t agree with it, or like it, but I feel like I can’t do anything about it.”</p>

<h3> Texas State offers cheap holiday travel</h3>

<h4>by Sophia De La Rosa</h4>


<p>San Marcos – Texas State Transportation Services announced Tuesday in a press release that Kerrville Bus Company will provide Thanksgiving holiday transportation to students, faculty and staff for a fare starting at ten dollars.</p>

<p>The Thanksgiving program provides transport from San Marcos to Austin, Dallas, Houston and others via two bus routes, with over 200 students already signed up.</p>

<p>With over 35,000 students on campus, however, the number of people taking advantage of the shuttle service is relatively low. </p>

<p>Lili Aguilar, a psychology major, is from the San Antonio area, a destination that is not being serviced by the company during the Thanksgiving break.</p>

<p>“I guess it could improve by expanding its travel spots,” Aguilar said. </p>

<p>While Aguilar prefers to drive herself, she said that she would want to see the university continue offering this service.</p>

<p>“It allows students to get home if they otherwise couldn’t,” Aguilar said. “A lot of students don’t have cars.”</p>

<p>Keenan Maxie, a theater major, said that the program is a good service for students wanting to visit friends at different universities.</p>

<p>Although Maxie has never used the service, he has seen the Kerrville shuttle on campus.</p>

<p>“It said like ‘Ten dollar rides to Austin’,” Maxie said. “I was like oh that’s neat. I didn’t know they were doing that.”</p>

<p>Lack of knowledge about the program seems to be a key reason for the low number of people taking advantage of it.</p>

<p>Maxie also said that the program could improve by expanding destinations and offering more frequent travel.</p>

<p>“I only saw (the shuttle) once,” Maxie said. “So I might be imagining it.”</p>

<p>Just this year, the company has increased services to each weekend after the success of last year’s holiday transportation pilot program, according to Shaun Sexton, operations manager for the Kerrville Bus Company.</p>

<h3>Election Reveals Texas State Political Diversity</h3>

<h4>by Sophia De La Rosa</h4>

<p>San Marcos – Election Day is quickly approaching as all of America anxiously awaits the announcement of the president-elect. In the largely Republican state of Texas, San Marcos proves to be a haven of diverse political beliefs.</p>

<p>This diversity may exist because of a millennial disappointment in the presidential candidates.</p>

<p>Caitlin Lemons, a sophomore Psychology major, is an Independent and supports Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.</p>

<p>“I could not stand behind the main party candidates at all,” said Lemons. “Living in a state that is predecided to be Republican, I wanted to vote for someone I personally felt good about.”</p>

<p>Lemons said that Johnson would be able to make a difference for the students at Texas State.</p>

<p>“Gary Johnson would get rid of core curriculum standards, therefore changing what students learn in school,” said Lemons. “He would also create more opportunities and make it easier to start a small business after graduation.”</p>

<p>Rena Brooker, a junior early childhood education major, supports the Republican candidate Donald Trump, although she also expressed concern for her options.</p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied with the choices that we have been given,” said Brooker. “But in my opinion, I chose the lesser of two evils.”</p>

<p>Brooker said that Trump would be the one to bring jobs to recent graduates.</p>

<p>“Hopefully after students graduate, there will be a larger pool of jobs available than there is now,” said Brooker. “There are so many people fresh out of college that struggle to find a stable job which should not be the case.”</p>

<p>Trae Waters, a senior business finance major, is a Democrat in favor of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate.</p>

<p>Stein will create better job opportunities and lower interest rates on student loans, Waters said.</p>

<h3>New Apple Campus brings 3,600 Jobs to Austin</h3>

<h4>By Sophia De La Rosa</h4>

<p>AUSTIN – Today, Gov. Rick Perry announced that Apple will invest in a new campus in Austin, creating 3,600 new jobs and more than doubling the size of Apple’s workforce in Texas.</p>

<p>Texas’ reasonable and predictable regulations and low taxes are a perfect economic climate for high-tech companies, said Perry in a press release. </p>

<p>The Texas Enterprise Fund (TEF) also plays a part in drawing in visionary companies, offering companies incentives to invest in Texas. </p>

<p>The TEF, with the approval of the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House, has offered Apple an investment of $21 million over ten years.</p>

<p>“Investments like this further Texas’ potential to become the nation’s next high-tech hub,” said Perry.</p>

<p>After the project is completed, it will be one of the largest job creation projects in TEF history and one of the largest capital investments by a TEF recipient, according to a press release. </p>

<h3> Texas State student survives 34-foot fall, wakes up from four day coma </h3>

<h4>by Sophia De La Rosa</h4>

<p>CANYON LAKE, TEXAS –A routine afternoon run at the Canyon Lake cliffside trail went horribly awry when Maggie Daniel, a student at Texas State University, lost her footing and plummeted 34 feet into rock-filled waters on Thursday. </p>

<p>Randy Davis, a boat mechanic, was fishing nearby and saw Daniel fall into the water. He immediately called 911. “I tried to drive my boat over to her, but the water was extremely rough that day and those rocks don’t make it any easier,” Davis said.</p>

<p>EMS workers arrived within minutes, but were unsure if she would survive. Tom Henderson, a paramedic, described the scene upon his arrival: “When we saw her on the lakeshore, her body looked lifeless,” Henderson said, “I have seen falls before, but this one really scared me.”</p>

<p>Dr. Blaine Hollins, lead surgeon at Santa Rosa Hospital, said that Daniel came in with a broken arm, broken ribs, and many cuts and abrasions, but her head injury troubled Hollins the most. “We placed her in a medically induced coma to allow the swelling in her brain to reduce,” Hollins said.</p>

<p>Daniel remained in a coma until Sunday. “When we brought her out of the coma, we were shocked and excited to see that she had no apparent permanent damage,” Hollins reported.</p>

<p>Daniel however, was unaware that four days had passed since the incident. Scott Pilgrim, a detective from New Braunfels police department, said that when Daniel woke up, she asked if she could call her professor and tell him that she will be missing the exam tomorrow. “I laughed and told her I think you’ll be excused,” Pilgrim said, “Talk about commitment.”</p>

<p>“I was so scared,” Daniel said, “All I remember is falling and waking up in a hospital.” Daniel runs along the path all the time because she is training for a marathon, but says that she has never had a problem. “I am just so thankful that someone saw me fall,” Daniel said.</p>

<p>“We feel she will make a full recovery,” Dr. Hollins said, “I don’t know that she’ll be running that marathon like she planned but maybe next year.”</p>

<p>Henderson, her paramedic, was astounded that Daniel survived a fall that is fatal to most people. “She’s definitely a fighter,” Henderson said, “…If this is any indication of her future, I’d bet she’s going to be really successful.”</p>

<h3>SAN MARCOS CONSTRUCTION CAUSES ROAD RAGE</h3>
<p align="center">(ANCHOR ON CAM)</p>
MANY SAN MARCOS RESIDENTS ARE UPSET AS LOOP 82 CONSTRUCTION CAUSES ROAD CLOSURES AND MORE TRAFFIC.
<p align="center">(ANCHOR/VO)</p>
THE 20.7 MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT HAS CONDENSED AQUARENA SPRINGS, A MAJOR ROAD TOWARD CAMPUS AND DOWNTOWN, INTO TWO LANES. 
CONSTRUCTION HAS ALSO CLOSED ROADS, SHUTTLE STOPS, AND 285 PARKING SPACES, CAUSING FRUSTRATION AMONG RESIDENTS. WE SPOKE WITH A TEXAS STATE STUDENT WHO HAS BEEN AFFECTED.
<p align="center">(MICHAEL KEEGAN)</p>
“I ACTUALLY MOVED TO CAPSTONE ON PURPOSE. I WAS GONNA RESIGN (WITH COPPER BEECH) BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT THEY WERE DOING THAT CONSTRUCTION I WAS LIKE, ‘THERE’S NO WAY I’M LIVING ON THAT SIDE,’”
<p align="center">(REPORTER DE LA ROSA)</p>
THESE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO KEEP UP WITH THE ALARMING GROWTH OF THE CITY AND TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF TRAFFIC. LOOP 82 WILL ADD TWO LANES TO EACH SIDE OF AQUARENA SPRINGS DRIVE, ALONG WITH AN OVERPASS TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS TO AVOID TRAIN DELAYS. 
<p align="center">(ANCHOR ON CAM)</p>
TEXAS STATE STUDENTS ARE AMONG THOSE MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED AS BUSES ARE REROUTED AND COMMUTES TAKE LONGER.
<p align="center">(MICHAEL KEEGAN)</p>
“I HAVE EIGHT A.M.’S ALL WEEK. I TRY TO GET (TO THE BUS STOP) 30 TO 45 MINUTES EARLY. USUALLY IF IT’S 30, I’M LATE TO MY CLASS. AS ALWAYS.”
<p align="center">(REPORTER DE LA ROSA)</p>
EVEN AS THE CONSTRUCTION CAUSES THIS INCONVENIENCE, RESIDENTS EAGERLY AWAIT THE RESULTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE SEEN IN MARCH OF 2018. BUT UNTIL THEN…
<p align="center">(MICHAEL KEEGAN)</p>
“I WOULD JUST LIKE THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DETOURS ARE TIMELY BECAUSE TRAFFIC IS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS.”

<p align="center">Bobcat Build 2016</p>

<p>SAN MARCOS – Students prepare to give back to the community and connect with residents during the 15th annual Bobcat Build, an event scheduled for 8 am on April 2nd.</p>

<p>4,200 volunteers are set to tackle up to 270 job sites in a single day, a day that has taken a year of planning. </p>

<p>“It takes all year to make this happen, and it’s organized all by students,” said Emily Lund, the co-chair of Bobcat Build. “We worked through spring break to put everything in place for this year.”</p>

<p>These year-long preparations may come in light of the increasing popularity of the program. “The community has gotten more and more aware about the program,” Lund said, “Every year we see an increase in job sites.”</p>

<p>Ashley McGhee, president of Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Society said that her group worked at the Centro Esperanza Community Center. “We cleaned windows, organized a closet and picked up trash outside the community center,” McGhee said. “After we finished that, we walked down to the soccer field about two blocks and picked up trash so that someone could mow it and kids could use it.”</p>

<p>Bobcat Build, however, is much deeper than community service. “I think it’s our job as students to give back to the community,” McGhee said. “We come here and party and enjoy the land, so it’s important to help the residents of San Marcos who let us basically rent their area.”</p>

<p>Naomi Faltin, program co-chair, said that she has been a Bobcat Build volunteer for three years. “I feel that millennials sometimes get a bad reputation, so this is our chance to meet with homeowners and show them we are grateful,” Faltin said, “We want to show them we appreciate all they do for us.”</p>

<p>This student movement has attracted a lot of attention, especially from some big-name sponsors. This year, sponsors include Starbucks, Monster, Kind Bars, Erbert and Gerbert’s, and others. </p>

<p>Bobcat Build is an annual event that is organized by students. In addition to helping the community, students are building friendships with local residents. For more information about the program, please visit http://www.bobcatbuild.txstate.edu or follow @BobcatBuild on Twitter.</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks for a Successful Career Fair from Lilly Montalvo, Career Services Advisor</h3>

<p>SAN MARCOS—Career Services advisor Lilly Montalvo spoke to students Thursday morning and gave insider advice on how to use Texas State’s Career Fair to their advantage.</p>

<p>Montalvo first emphasized the importance of professional behavior, “It is really important to make a good first impression, so dress business professional.” She also mentioned to wear a nametag near your right shoulder, “When you go in for a shake, they can very easily see your nametag.” And that is another thing: have a firm handshake.</p>

<p>Montalvo also said to bring 15-20 copies of your resume, but bringing a portfolio or business card in addition can make you stand out. </p>

<p>Students usually attend the fair eager to speak to a specific company, but Montalvo said to talk to three or four that you are semi-interested in first to get warmed up. Remember to talk to different employers, even if they do not entirely interest you. “Keep your options open, don’t limit yourself… You never know who they know,” Montalvo said. </p>

<p>Before you go to the Career Fair, remember to do some background research. Questions tailored to the employer can help get a conversation going. “Remember to think about your personal preferences also… just ask what you would like to know,” Montalvo said, “Ask about the culture of the working environment.” Not only are you trying to appeal to employers, employers are trying to appeal to you also. </p>

<p>After some back-and-forth dialogue, give them your resume and ask for a card. “Make a note of something you talked about on the back,” Montalvo said. This note can help when writing follow-up email; reemphasize your interest in the company and mention an aspect of your conversation to make it unique. </p>

<p>Montalvo emphasized that the Career Services office is available to help in any way that they can. As of this fall, the Career Closet has been open to students as a professional wardrobe. “You can just go there, see what fits you…” Montalvo said. It is free to rent any attire there, “Money is tight when you’re in college, I know.”</p>
