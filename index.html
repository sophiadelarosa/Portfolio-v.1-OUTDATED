  		<h3 align="center"> About Me </h3>
  		<p align="center"> Originally from Knoxville, Tennessee, Sophia moved to San Marcos, Texas in 2014 to attend Texas State University. With her father, Joel De La Rosa, working for CNN in Dallas, Sophia has been exposed to journalism from a very young age. She soon gained interest also, and focused her curriculum and extra curricular activities to gain as much experience as possible. </p>
  			<img src="img/about1.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded" width="200" height="550"/>
		<p align="center"> She began traveling at age 11, and has since photographed the streets of many European countries. These travels drove her desire to excel in honors language courses, including Spanish and German, while taking advanced English classes. In addition, Sophia took an internship at the Knoxville News Sentinel where she conducted interviews, gathered b-roll, and gained video editing experience. Two of her videos were posted onto the News Sentinel's website. </p>
			<img src="img/about2.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded" width="200" height="550"/>
		<p align="center"> This experience quickly led to more opportunities. Shopper News, another local newspaper, asked her to write a column and take photos covering "Night of the Arts," an annual event at her school. This event also gave her the opportunity to showcase work that she had created while in AP Studio, an advanced studio art class. Here, she won first place in Mixed Media for her piece titled "Word on the Street," which incorporated original photography prints, newspaper strips and acrylic and watercolor paints. Her article on the event was published soon after, on May 4th, 2014. </p>
			<img src="img/about3.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded" width="200" height="550"/>
		<p align="center"> As a senior in high school, Sophia went on to dual-enroll at Pellissippi State Community College for her basic college English courses. Having spent three years on the high school yearbook staff, she was now head photojournalist. During her years here, she took pictures, wrote feature stories, conducted interviews, and worked her way up in positions each year. She also designed the yearbook theme two years in a row, having her third theme carried out by the team after her graduation. </p>
			<img src="img/about4.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded" width="200" height="550"/>
		<p align="center"> After five semesters in college, Sophia is now a senior. During this time, she has gained interviewing, video editing, and web design experience, and now works as a photographer and news reporter for the University Star. With this experience, Sophia hopes to one day work for National Geographic. She looks forward to writing and photographing her travels as she experiences new cultures and meets interesting people. </p>
